## üéØ Calibration Guide

### What Calibration Does
Calibration creates **YOUR personalized targets** based on your 5 best repetitions instead of using generic defaults (95¬∞ ROM, 3.2s speed). This makes feedback much more accurate since everyone's body and exercise form are different.

### Why Calibration is Important
- **Generic targets may not suit you**: Default 95¬∞ ROM might be too high/low for your body
- **Personalized feedback**: Get accurate "Good/Caution/Poor" ratings based on YOUR capabilities
- **Better motivation**: Targets that match your actual best performance are more achievable
- **Improved accuracy**: No more "Poor" ratings when you're actually doing well for your body type

### When to Calibrate
- **First time setup**: Always calibrate when you first use the device
- **Position changes**: If you move the device to a different location on your leg
- **Inaccurate feedback**: If ratings seem off (too easy or too hard)
- **After long breaks**: If you haven't used the device in weeks/months

### Calibration Process (Real-Time Progress with Dynamic Validation)
1. **Set your standards** - Adjust Target ROM and Max Speed in settings first
2. **Connect to Arduino** and click "Calibrate (5 Reps)" button
3. **Watch live progress** - button updates: "Calibrating... (1/5)", "Calibrating... (2/5)", etc.
4. **Perform 5 PERFECT squats** - only squats meeting YOUR settings count:
   - **ROM requirement**: ‚â•80% of your Target ROM setting
   - **Speed requirement**: ‚â§150% of your Max Speed setting
   - **Rejected squats**: Clear feedback shows why (too shallow, too fast)
5. **Automatic completion** - system calculates and applies your personal targets
6. **Ready to exercise** - all future reps evaluated against YOUR standards

### Calibration Best Practices
1. **Perfect form only**: Use your absolute BEST technique for all 5 reps
2. **Consistent positioning**: Keep device in exact same position throughout calibration
3. **Full range of motion**: Use your maximum comfortable ROM
4. **Steady pace**: Use your ideal, controlled speed
5. **Focus and concentration**: Don't rush - quality over speed
6. **Wait for updates** - each squat completion shows progress on the app

### Understanding Results
After calibration, check your new targets in the settings:
- **ROM Target**: Your average maximum bend angle (updated automatically)
- **Speed Target**: Your average angular velocity (updated automatically)
- **These become your new "Good" standards** for all future exercises
- **Real-time sync** - Arduino and app communicate seamlessly during calibration

## üîä Sound Alerts

### Audio Feedback System
- **Good Form**: üîá **Silent** (no beep - good form shouldn't interrupt)
- **Caution Form**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **Medium beep** (600Hz, 0.15s) - gentle warning
- **Poor Form**: ‚ùå **Lower, longer beep** (300Hz, 0.4s) - needs attention

### Sound Controls
- **Toggle**: ON/OFF button in Adjust Settings
- **Test Sound**: Plays when you turn sound alerts ON
- **Persistent**: Setting saves automatically across sessions
- **Works**: Both demo mode and real Arduino data

## ‚öôÔ∏è Interactive Settings

### Adjustable Thresholds (Realistic Biomechanical Ranges)
- **Target ROM**: Set your ideal knee flexion (30¬∞-150¬∞ range) - 90¬∞ = parallel squat standard
- **Max Speed for "Controlled" Rating**: Set angular velocity threshold (20¬∞/s-50¬∞/s) - lower = more controlled
- **+/- Controls**: Click buttons to adjust values in real-time
- **Auto-Save**: Settings persist across browser sessions
- **Live Updates**: Changes affect evaluation immediately

### Dynamic Color-Coding (Based on Realistic Knee Biomechanics)
- **ROM Tolerance**: Target ¬±10¬∞ = Good, Target ¬±25¬∞ = Caution, beyond = Poor
- **Speed Evaluation**: ‚â§Target = Controlled (Good), Target to 1.5x = Moderate (Caution), >1.5x = Too Fast (Poor)
- **Smoothness Analysis**: RMS Jerk <50 = Smooth, 50-150 = Moderate, >150 = Jerky
- **Instant Feedback**: Both demo and real data use your custom thresholds

## üìä Performance Metrics (Biomechanically Accurate)

### Default Thresholds (Personalized via Calibration)
- **ROM Target**: 90¬∞ knee flexion (Good: 80¬∞-100¬∞, Caution: 65¬∞-115¬∞, Poor: <65¬∞ or >115¬∞)
- **Speed Target**: 30¬∞/s angular velocity (Good: ‚â§30¬∞/s, Caution: 30-45¬∞/s, Poor: >45¬∞/s)
- **Smoothness**: RMS Jerk analysis (Good: <50, Caution: 50-150, Poor: >150)
- **Knee Flexion Range**: 0¬∞ (standing) to 150¬∞ (deep squat) with 30¬∞ minimum for valid reps

### Realistic Squat Biomechanics

**Knee Flexion Ranges:**
- **0¬∞**: Standing (full leg extension)
- **30¬∞**: Quarter squat (minimum for valid rep)
- **90¬∞**: Parallel squat (standard rehabilitation target)  
- **130-150¬∞**: Deep squat (advanced range)

**Angular Velocity Guidelines:**
- **20¬∞/s**: Slow, controlled pace (~4.5 seconds per squat)
- **30¬∞/s**: Standard controlled pace (~3 seconds per squat)
- **40¬∞/s**: Moderate pace (~2.25 seconds per squat)
- **50¬∞/s**: Upper safe limit (~1.8 seconds per squat)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Web App Issues
- **"Web Bluetooth not supported"**: Use Chrome or Edge browser
- **Can't connect**: Make sure Arduino is advertising as "REHABAND"
- **Connection drops**: Stay within 10m range of Arduino

### Arduino Issues
- **Upload fails**: Check board selection (Arduino Nano 33 BLE)
- **Libraries missing**: Install ArduinoBLE and Arduino_BMI270_BMM150 (or Arduino_LSM9DS1 for older boards)
- **Not advertising**: Check serial monitor for "BLE device active" message
- **Wrong IMU library**: Change to `Arduino_LSM9DS1.h` if you have an older board

### BLE Connection Issues
- **Device not found**: Reset Arduino and try again
- **Connection timeout**: Make sure Arduino sketch is running
- **No data**: Check that Arduino is detecting movement

### Session Controls Issues
- **Buttons disabled/grayed**: Make sure you're connected to Arduino device first
- **Start Session not working**: Check connection status and try reconnecting
- **Calibration stuck**: Disconnect and reconnect, then try calibration again

### Calibration Issues
- **Weird results after calibration**: Your 5 reps may have been inconsistent - try again with more consistent form
- **Targets too high/low**: Reset to defaults by manually adjusting ROM/Speed in settings
- **"Poor" ratings after calibration**: Device position may have shifted - try recalibrating
- **How to reset calibration**: Manually adjust ROM and Speed targets back to 95¬∞ and 3.2s
